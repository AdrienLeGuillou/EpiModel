EpiModel provides tools for simulating mathematical models of infectious disease. Epidemic model classes include deterministic compartmental models, stochastic individual contact models, and stochastic network models. Disease types include SI, SIR, and SIS epidemics with and without demography, with tools available for expansion to model complex epidemic processes. 


### Installation
The current software version is **EpiModel v1.0.1**, which may be downloaded from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiModel/index.html), and from within R using:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("EpiModel")
```


### Documentation

* [EpiModel Manual](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiModel/EpiModel.pdf): a PDF manual of the help documentation within the package, with entries for the core package functions.
* [EpiModel News](https://github.com/statnet/EpiModelPreview/releases): major changes were implemented in EpiModel v1.0. This news file (also contained within the package) lists those and more recent changes.


### EpiModel Web
For beginning EpiModel users and those new to mathematical modeling generally, EpiModel includes two web-based applications for simulating epidemics, using the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) framework in R. These applications are included within EpiModel itself for deterministic compartmental models and stochastic individual contact models and may be run, respectively, using:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
epiweb(class = "dcm")
epiweb(class = "icm")
```
Alternatively, these applications are hosted online at:

* [Deterministic Compartmental Models](http://statnet.shinyapps.io/epidcm)
* [Stochastic Individual Contact Models](http://statnet.shinyapps.io/epiicm)


### Software Tutorials

##### Main Tutorial
[EpiModel Tutorial](http://statnet.org/EpiModel/vignette/Tutorial.pdf): provides an overview of the functionality of EpiModel, with a focus on using the integrated model types to parameterize and simulate deterministic and stochastic epidemic models.

##### Utilities
[Network Utility Functions](http://statnet.org/EpiModel/vignette/NetUtils.html): shows extended examples of utility functions within EpiModel that help with the parameterization of stochastic network models.

##### Extending EpiModel

* [New DCMs with EpiModel](http://statnet.org/EpiModel/vignette/NewDCMs.html): how to build an original deterministic compartmental model by writing a model function and passing new parameters.
* [New ICMs with EpiModel](http://statnet.org/EpiModel/vignette/NewICMs.html): how to build an original stochastic individual contact model by writing replacement and supplemental module functions.
* [New Network Models with EpiModel](http://statnet.org/EpiModel/vignette/NewNet.html): how to build an original stochastic network model by writing replacement and supplemental module functions.


### Workshops / Trainings

##### Network Modeling for Epidemics
This 6-day yearly summer course introduces traditional compartmental models for epidemics, the methodology for classical descriptive network analysis, and new statistical methods for network analysis using exponential-family random graph models. The final goal is then to use these methods to develop stochastic network models for epidemics, with a focus on empirical models of HIV/STI transmission and control.

##### Sunbelt Conference
Sunbelt is the yearly conference of the International Network for Social Network Analysis. The conference offers several workshops for software tools, and statnet developers have been teaching there for several years. 2014 was the first year featuring an EpiModel workshop.
